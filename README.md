🎓 Udemy Clone – HTML & CSS Project
Welcome to my Udemy Clone — a sleek and responsive front-end recreation of the popular online learning platform. Built purely with HTML and CSS, this project showcases a clean layout, organized course cards, navigation bar, footer, and category sections, all crafted to mirror the real Udemy experience (minus the complex backend magic).

🔧 Features
🎯 Responsive navigation bar with search functionality

📚 Course cards for recommended and popular sections

🧠 Topic recommendations styled with hover effects

🎨 Fully custom styling using modern CSS techniques

📱 Clean, mobile-friendly layout (with basic responsiveness)

⚠️ Note: This is a static front-end project. No JavaScript or backend logic is implemented — yet! Stay tuned for updates as I grow this into a fully functional platform.
